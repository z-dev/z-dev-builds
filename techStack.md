# ZDEV's technology

## Tech Stack
- [Javascript ES6+](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ECMAScript) modern JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for websites
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for Apps
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) for servers
- [Next](https://nextjs.org/) for server side rendering [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a database for MVP projects
- [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/) for web-scraping

## Experience

- We've put 20+ React / React Native / Redux / Node applications into production
- We've built [tools](https://github.com/z-dev/rn-scaffold) to start best practice React Native codebases quickly
- We have common components we reuse between projects - for example our [credit card checkout component](https://github.com/z-dev/react-native-checkout)

## Code Quality
- Our senior developers review all our code using Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/) / [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) / [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com)
- We [Lint](https://eslint.org/) all our code to check for common mistakes
- We auto-format our code with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/) for consistency
- [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) builds our code and checks the lint & prettier rules
- All our codebases run the lint and auto-format our code before committing

## Automatic deployment

- [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) automatically deploys the code once a build is successful
- We deploy websites using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) website deployments
- Server code / [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers are deployed using [Now](https://zeit.co/now) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

## Take a look at some code we're proud of

We've built a [site](https://builds.z-dev.com) using React, Redux & Node to demonstrate how we build things
